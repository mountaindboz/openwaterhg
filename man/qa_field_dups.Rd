\format{
data frame with 460 rows and 19 columns
\describe{
\item{SampleCode_PS}{The unique identifier for the associated parent sample
    produced by Bryte Lab}
\item{SampleCode_FD}{The unique identifier for the field duplicate sample
    produced by Bryte Lab}
\item{StationName}{The name of the station where the field duplicate was
    collected}
\item{SampleDate}{The collection date of the field duplicate and parent
    samples}
\item{CollectionTime_PS}{The collection time of the associated parent
    sample in PST}
\item{CollectionTime_FD}{The collection time of the field duplicate
    sample in PST}
\item{Analyte}{The analytical parameter measured}
\item{Result_PS}{The analytical result of the associated parent sample}
\item{Result_FD}{The analytical result of the field duplicate sample}
\item{RPD}{The relative percent difference between the field duplicate sample
    and the associated parent sample. This was calculated as the absolute
    difference between the two values divided by their average and expressed as
    a percent. RPD's greater than their Measurement Quality Objectives were
    flagged as "FV" in \code{Flag}. This only applied to duplicate pairs
    where at least one value was greater than ten times the Reporting Limit.}
\item{ResQual}{A numeric variable that represents whether either of the results
    were below the detection limit (RL or MDL). A value of "0" indicates that
    the results of both samples were detected, a value of "1" indicates that
    both samples were below the detection limit, and a value of "0.5" indicates
    that either the field duplicate or parent sample was below the detection
    limit.}
\item{RL}{The analytical reporting limit of the sample}
\item{MDL}{The analytical method detection limit of the sample}
\item{Units}{The units of the result}
\item{LabComments_PS}{Comments provided by the analytical laboratory for the
    associated parent sample}
\item{LabComments_FD}{Comments provided by the analytical laboratory for the
    field duplicate sample}
\item{MME_Comments_PS}{Comments provided by staff from the Mercury Monitoring and
    Evaluation section for the associated parent sample}
\item{MME_Comments_FD}{Comments provided by staff from the Mercury Monitoring and
    Evaluation section for the field duplicate sample}
\item{Flag}{Flag for the sample pair. "FV" indicates that the pair has a RPD value
    greater than its acceptable limit.}

\description{
Contains all field duplicate data collected for the Yolo Bypass
    Mass Balance Study. Field duplicates were collected each day water samples
    were collected to test for sample reproducibility and field variability.
    The duplicates and their associated parent samples were separated from
    the raw data files in the "Compile_and_Clean_Conc_Data.R" script file.
